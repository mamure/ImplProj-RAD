# Tutorial

Requires Dotnet v8.0
Run `dotnet build` from the directory to build the binaries.
Run `dotnet run` to run the binaries. This will run the different benchmarks and genereate data. Be warned, this takes a while.
Run the python script `plot.py` to view the data. The repo includes the data we generated, so this script should work of the box.
